```

### Key Technologies

- **React 18** + **TypeScript** - Type-safe UI
- **Zustand** - Lightweight state management
- **MediaBunny** - Video/audio processing
- **WebCodecs** - Hardware encoding/decoding
- **WebGPU** - GPU-accelerated rendering
- **Web Audio API** - Professional audio processing
- **THREE.js** - 3D transforms and effects
- **IndexedDB** - Local project storage

### Design Principles

- **Action-based editing** - Every edit is an undoable action
- **Immutable state** - Predictable updates with Zustand
- **Engine separation** - Video, audio, graphics engines are independent
- **Progressive enhancement** - Graceful fallbacks (WebGPU → Canvas2D)
